Hi and welcome in the Indoorway's test for interns.

Don't be scared by the amount of tasks, you don't have to do it all.
Just try the best you can do. Start with the HTML and CSS
and then jump into JS if you're up to it.

Fork this pen by clicking button in the top right
(you don't have to create an account), then modify the page according to TODOs.

You can do whatever you want as long as it works.

Remember to save your work and when you are done, send a link back to us.

Good luck!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODOs:
1. #stuffShop should cover 100% of height.
2. Why header doesn't have a 'nice color'?
- **Write your answer here.**
3. What we can do with our header cutted off?
- **Write your answer here and try to fix it.**
4. Clicking 'stuff' label should set focus to stuff select.
5. Every second element of #cart list should have different color.
6. Remove bullet points from #cart list elements.
7. Form elements should be in column.
8. Shop's logo have to be on the right side, vertically aligned in the middle.
9. Is it looking nice? What else you can do?
- **Write some ideas here or modify the page and write what you have done:)**
