Hi and welcome in the Indoorway's test for interns.

Don't be scared by the amount of tasks, you don't have to do it all.
Just try the best you can do. Start with the HTML and CSS
and then jump into JS if you're up to it.

Fork this pen by clicking button in the top right
(you don't have to create an account), then modify the page according to TODOs.

You can do whatever you want as long as it works.

Remember to save your work and when you are done, send a link back to us.

Good luck!

TODOs:
1. #stuffShop should cover 100% of height.
KN: 100% of height of...? :) To my mind this point is not very precise. I assumed it's about the 100% of the viewport.

2. Why header doesn't have a 'nice color'?
- **Write your answer here.**
KN: The color is overwritten by the color (salmon) associated to #header id. There are 2 reasons of the overwriting: cascading rule in CSS (the salmon color is lower in the CSS document) and selector specifity (id selector, i.e. #header, is stronger than class selector, i.e. .niceColor)

3. What we can do with our header cutted off?
- **Write your answer here and try to fix it.**
There are a few ways of fixing this depending on what the question exactly refers to and on the exact effect you want to achieve:
a) if you mean the #header's corners being cut off the obvious thing is to remove the border radius in #header selector. It fixes a problem of h4 text which is also cut off at the same time. However...
b) ...if you want to keep the rounded corners of the #header and fix the h4 problem only, you can remove 'overflow: hidden;' from #header selector and add 'padding: 1px 0;' instead. It's not an aesthetic solution though because the h4 text still sticks out of the #header. This is why...
c) ...I would recommend (still assuming you want to keep the rounded corners) simply adding a left (and optionally right) padding to #header and this is what I did.

4. Clicking 'stuff' label should set focus to stuff select.
KN: Label's 'for' should be the same as select's 'id' so I changed the 'for' attribute to 'stuffSelect'.

5. Every second element of #cart list should have different color.
6. Remove bullet points from #cart list elements.
7. Form elements should be in column.
8. Shop's logo have to be on the right side, vertically aligned in the middle.
KN: In the middle of...? I assumed that it refers to the middle of the parent, #header.

9. Is it looking nice? What else you can do?
- **Write some ideas here or modify the page and write what you have done:)**
To be honest, no, it does not look nice to me :D Neither graphics, nor the code itself. I would modify both.

- reset? -> maybe recommended only
- BEM + no ids/* in CSS
- container?
- class to each cart element (li in JS)
- select's and button's look
- RWD
